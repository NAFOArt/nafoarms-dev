And while we cannot go into details yet, we will post another update as soon as the ptototypes pass field testing.

If luck has it, by the end of the month it will be in full scale production.

While we are working on Leyley-V2, you can help us deliver current version Leyleys and other aid to the Ukrainian Armed Forces!
